# Acumatica Surveys Phase 3 (Beta) README #

*August 3rd 2021*

Please note that this release is in large part a "re-architecture" of the Surveys project as we have expanded the functionality greatly, requiring rewriting a large portion of code.

## Setup Instructions for Installing the Phase 3 Acumatica Surveys package

**Step One:** Download the customization package (AcumaticaSurveyPkg.zip) appropriate for your version of Acumatica.  Curently, we support the following versions:

**Acumatica 2020R1 (Build 20.100.0095 onward)**

Editor's note: I'll updarte the build after I get confirmation from St√©phane on which builds going forward are supported.
