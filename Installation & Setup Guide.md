# Acumatica Surveys 
## Installation & Setup Guide (Draft)

Currently, all the information for installing and setup of Acumatica Surveys is in the readme.md file/document - an extensive step-by-step guide for customers to successfully install & setup the customization package. Now that we are in phase two of the project, it is time to have an improved structure for documenting information such as release notes, readme, and documentation guides.

The planned changes will enhance the readibility and utility of the documentation itself.
